## Install distrandomizer

1. First you will need to install the [Centrifuge] modding framework.
   There's already an install guide for Centrifuge so [I'll just link to it here.]
   Follow that for guidance.
2. You will also need to install the [Distance GSL for Centrifuge].
   1. Download the latest version of the GSL from the [releases page].
   2. In the `Centrifuge.Distance.zip` archive you download, copy the
      `Centrifuge/GameSupport/Centrifuge.Distance.dll` file to the
      `Distance/Distance_Data/Centrifuge/GameSupport` directory.
3. Next you can install the Distance Randomizer plugin itself.
   1. Download the latest version of the Randomizer mod [here].
   2. Extract the `DistanceRando` folder inside of `DistanceRando-[version].zip` to the
      `Distance/Distance_Data/Centrifuge/Mods` directory.
4. You should be done. Run the game, press `R` on the main menu, enter a seed, then
   start on Instantiation to begin your randomzied adventures.
