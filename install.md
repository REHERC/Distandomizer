Install instructions to be completed, I'll admit I am... lazy and can't be arsed to write documentation atm.

TL;DR is you need Centrifuge and the Distance GSL, then you extract the `distrandomizer.zip` you download into your `Centrifuge/Mods` directory.
If you've installed other mods for Distance already you will already know how to do this; if not, I guess you'll just have to ask someone else for now.
