# Distance Randomizer (new! now for 1.0)
A Centrifuge plugin that randomizes Distance's Adventure mode.

## Changes from the normal game
- All maps and abilities have been rearranged into a random order.
- Boost is enabled from the start, you don't need to pass through an ability trigger for it.
- Wing corruption zones are no longer present to allow for more variety in the map order.
- The majority of the tutorial text in the game has been removed, since you don't need to learn
  how to play the game in rando.
- Most warpanchors have been disabled/removed in order to speed up the game.

## How to play
In order to play randomizer games you will need to install the plugin. Currently, the Centrifuge/1.0
verison is still under development and is not released yet. Older versions for the Beta/Early Access
verison of Distance are still available on the releases page, but they won't work on the latest
version of the game (and are also built for Spectrum, and older modding framework.)

Once you have installed Centrifuge and the randomizer plugin, you're ready to go. Press `R` on the main menu
to open up the seed entry prompt. You can either use a specific seed, or leave the
field blank to generate a random seed. If you're doing a race, I'd recommend making everybody
use the same seed to keep things fair. Once you've entered the seed you want, press Enter - this
will set the seed and prime randomizer. Once you're ready to start the game, go into the
Adventure menu and start from Instantiation. The rando game will then be generated, allowing you
to actually play it. If you decide you don't want to play rando after all, loading any map except the
intro will cancel the rando game.

Obviously, since the abilities are given to you in a random order, you may not be able to
complete things in the original way, so you'll have to use unusual strats to complete some
maps. Remember that you can slam your car against walls to shove it off of roads without jump,
and note that it's possible to drive up the arrows on some jump barriers. Sometimes you may get
stuck behind a checkpoint; you may need to go backwards to give yourself enough room to pass it.
It should be impossible to get totally stuck, but if that ever does happen, make sure you toss
an issue my way with that seed so I can see what went wrong.

Skipping ability triggers will still give you the ability you would have gotten in the previous
map like the normal game, so don't be afriad to skip ability triggers in some maps in the interest of saving time.
If you want to keep track of the maps and abilities you've already completed/unlocked, [I've made a simple tracker](https://tiyenti.github.io/disttracker)
that will allow you to do that.
